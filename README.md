When I moved to Germany, I had the chance of decorating my own room, therefore, LED lights were a must. After learning some microcontrollers and coding knowledge, I knew I could tinker with my LED strips. Unfortunately, the first step was to break the IR controller box that came with strip, in order to look at the circuit… solely for research purposes, of course. 

## Technologies and tools used
12V LED strip, C/C++ with Arduino IDE, Arduino UNO Rev3 board, MOSFET Transistors, jumper wires, 12V adapter, solder kit 
## Procedure 
- I cut the LED strip where it had the signs for +12V, Green, Red and Blue then soldered jumper wires to the copper areas 
- Made LED controller circuit with MOSFETs and resistors •	Attached jumper wires to the uno board Challenges & solutions 
- LED strip ripping when detaching from the wall- slower detaching, soldering parts back together 
- Sections of the RGB diodes malfunctioning- cutting and joining functioning parts 
## Further applications 
This was quite straight forward so the applications are quite broad. To me, the natural progression of this project, would involve a home security system (blinks red when an intruder is recognized), or a system involving Computer Vision.
